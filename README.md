# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : July 6 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge and also completed chosing the projects I will work on .

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exiciting ,will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way.

## Day 1 : July 7 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I had built a linear regrssion using Gradient Descent from scratch by referring siraj's [How to Do Linear Regression using Gradient Descent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdM6ER7zTLk).

**Thoughts** : The concept was very good and helped me to write code for complex formula.

## Day 2 : July 8 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I had studied a Logistic Regression by referring siraj's [Logistic Regression - The Math of Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8alok2P468).

**Thoughts** : Explaining was pretty good and i learned visualization too.

## Day 3 : July 9 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I had studied and built a Polynomial Regression and Data Preprocessing model.

**Thoughts** : Learned to visualize polynomial regression and processing data for better use.

## Day 4 : July 10 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I had studied and built a Multiple Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression model.

**Thoughts** : Learned to visualize Decision Tree Regression and Multiple Linear Regression using Backward Elimination.

## Day 5 : July 11 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I had studied and built a SVR and Random Forest Regression.

**Thoughts** : Learned to visualize SVR and Random Forest Regression.

**Link of Work:**   [Link](https://github.com/ratansingh98/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/days/Day%205%20:%20SVR%20and%20Random%20Forest%20Regression)

## Day 6 : July 12 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : Studied and built K-Nearest, SVM and Kernal SVM.

**Thoughts** : Learned to visualize  K-Nearest, SVM and Kernal SVM.

**Link of Work:**   [Link](https://github.com/ratansingh98/100_Days_of_ML_Code/tree/master/days/Day%206%20:%20K-Nearest%2CSVM%20and%20Kernal%20SVM)
