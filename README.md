# 100 Days Of ML - LOG

## Day 0 : July 6 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge and also completed chosing the projects I will work on .

**Thoughts** : Hope this will be exiciting ,will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more effective way.

## Day 1 : July 7 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I had built a linear regrssion using Gradient Descent from scratch by referring siraj's [How to Do Linear Regression using Gradient Descent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdM6ER7zTLk).

**Thoughts** : The concept was very good and helped me to write code for complex formula.

## Day 2 : July 8 , 2018
 
**Today's Progress** : I had study a Logistic Regression by referring siraj's [Logistic Regression - The Math of Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8alok2P468).

**Thoughts** : Explaining was pretty good and i learned visualization too.
